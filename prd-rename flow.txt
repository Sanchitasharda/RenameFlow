RenameFlow ________________________________________
1. Overview
Purpose
RenameFlow is a micro-tool designed to help users rename large batches of files quickly, accurately, and according to strict rule sets. It eliminates the repetitive manual process of renaming files and ensures consistency and accuracy across different file types.
 Ideal for photographers, developers, designers, archivists, and researchers, the tool can handle hundreds of files at once with rule-based automation.
________________________________________
2. Target Users
User Type	Primary Need	Example Use Case
Photographers	Rename hundreds of photos based on event/date pattern	Convert IMG_001.jpg → wedding-2025-001.jpg
Developers	Standardize asset names for deployment	Convert MyImage Final.png → my_image_final_v2.png
Designers	Add version suffixes to design exports	homepage.png → homepage_v3.png
Archivists / Researchers	Maintain naming consistency for stored data files	Report (Final).docx → report_final_2025_v2.docx
________________________________________
3. Key Objectives
●	Allow batch renaming of uploaded files in seconds.

●	Support multiple rule types that can be combined and ordered.

●	Provide instant preview before processing.

●	Generate a renamed ZIP file for quick download.

●	Maintain file integrity — only filenames change, not file contents.

●	Offer a clean, minimal, and fast web-based interface.

________________________________________
4. Core Features
A. Upload System
●	Upload Methods:

○	Upload individual files (drag & drop)

○	Upload a ZIP file containing files/folders

●	Accepted File Types: All common file formats (images, docs, audio, etc.)

●	Max Upload Limit: e.g., 500 files or 100MB total

●	Auto-extraction: If a ZIP file is uploaded, it is extracted server-side for processing.

________________________________________
B. Rule Engine (Main Feature)
Users can stack multiple rules in any order.
 Each rule will apply sequentially to the filename (not file content).
1. Casing Rules
●	Convert file names to:

○	snake_case → my_photo_file.jpg

○	camelCase → myPhotoFile.jpg

○	PascalCase → MyPhotoFile.jpg

○	UPPERCASE → MY_PHOTO_FILE.JPG

○	lowercase → my_photo_file.jpg

2. Prefix / Suffix Rules
●	Prefix: Add text before the filename (e.g., final_, 2025_)

●	Suffix: Add text after filename but before extension (e.g., _v2, _draft)

●	Support dynamic variables (optional future feature):

○	{date}, {time}, {originalName}, {counter}

3. Sequential Numbering
●	Add incremental numbering to filenames:

○	Pattern: photo-001.jpg, photo-002.jpg

○	Custom start value (default 1)

○	Custom padding (001, 01, 1)

○	Placement options:

■	Prefix numbering: 001_photo.jpg

■	Suffix numbering: photo_001.jpg

4. Find & Replace
●	Find a specific word/substring and replace it with another.

○	Example: draft → final

○	Support regex-based replace for advanced users (optional advanced toggle)

5. Custom Text Manipulation (optional future)
●	Trim spaces or special characters

●	Replace spaces with underscores or hyphens

●	Remove duplicate underscores/hyphens

________________________________________
C. Rule Management
●	Users can:

○	Add, edit, or delete rules dynamically.

○	Reorder rules via drag-and-drop to change the processing sequence.

●	Rule Preview Panel shows how filenames will look after each applied rule.

________________________________________
D. Live Preview
●	Displays a side-by-side list:

○	Original Filename → New Filename

●	Real-time updates as rules are added or modified.

●	Option to toggle preview on/off for large datasets.

________________________________________
E. Download Process
●	After applying all rules:

○	User clicks “Generate ZIP”

○	Server processes renaming logic.

○	A downloadable ZIP file with renamed files is generated.

●	The folder structure (if any) inside the uploaded ZIP remains preserved.

________________________________________
F. Undo / Reset
●	Undo Last Action: Step back one rule at a time.

●	Reset All Rules: Revert to original filenames.

________________________________________
G. History / Templates (Future Enhancement)
●	Save frequently used rule sets as templates.

○	Example: “Web Assets Naming”, “Photo Shoot Format”

●	Reuse templates for faster renaming sessions.

________________________________________
5. Technical Overview
Component	Description
Frontend	React (for dynamic UI updates, rule configuration, and preview)
Backend	Node.js with Express for file processing and ZIP generation
File Handling	multer for file uploads, adm-zip or JSZip for extraction & compression
Rule Engine	Modular renaming pipeline applying transformations in sequence
Storage	Temporary in-memory or disk storage (files auto-deleted after session)
Security	Input sanitization, filename validation, and temp file cleanup
Deployment	Serverless-friendly (Vercel / AWS Lambda) or standard Node server
________________________________________
6. User Flow
1.	Landing Page:

○	CTA: “Upload Your Files”

○	Optional short description + example GIF

2.	Upload Screen:

○	Drag & drop area / “Upload ZIP” button

○	Shows list of uploaded files

3.	Define Rules:

○	Add rules using dropdown (“Add Rule” → choose type)

○	Configure rule parameters (text fields, dropdowns, toggles)

○	Drag rules to reorder

4.	Preview:

○	Side-by-side “Before → After” filenames

○	Option to view 10, 50, or all

5.	Process & Download:

○	Click “Rename & Download”

○	Tool generates and provides ZIP for download

________________________________________
8. Edge Cases & Error Handling
Case	System Behavior
Duplicate filenames after rules	Automatically append _1, _2, etc.
Invalid filename characters	Auto-sanitize (remove `/:*?"<>
Empty upload	Show “Please upload files” prompt
Rule conflict (e.g., Find & Replace deletes full name)	Warn user before proceeding
Large files or ZIPs	Show progress bar; limit file count
________________________________________
9. UI/UX Considerations
●	Clean, minimalist dashboard-style layout

●	Color-coded rule cards for clarity

●	Real-time progress indicator during file processing

●	Accessibility: keyboard shortcuts for rule reordering, dark/light mode toggle

________________________________________
10. Future Enhancements
●	Cloud integration (Google Drive, Dropbox)

●	Rule-sharing (export/import templates)

●	CLI version for developers

●	API access for automation workflows

●	Advanced regex-based renaming

●	Date metadata extraction (e.g., from photo EXIF)

________________________________________
Would you like me to next create a UI wireframe + workflow diagram for this PRD (upload → rule definition → preview → download)?
 That would make it perfect for presenting to developers or as a hackathon/demo project proposal.
